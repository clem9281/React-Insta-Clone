Read this article about 'State Driven Views' and come up with a short paragraph as to why you feel that state-driven views are important to us as software developers today? What are state-driven applications? Why are they powerful? How does React enables those patterns?

    To develop a state driven application is different from a traditional architecture in that the state is the starting point for the application, rather than a side effect. Any change in the application or interface can be thought of in terms of state, rather than a series of changing elements. This is important to us as developers today because it lets us create more concise applications with better flow. State driven application are powerful because they are easier to test and visualize, and they reduce cognitive load. It reduces cognitive load because you know for certain what part of the state you are influencing. React allows us to do all of this by allowing us to build and define components and how they interact with the state.
